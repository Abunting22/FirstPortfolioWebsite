            <p>
                Originally, I wanted to go to medical school, but that was not the right fit for me.
                I graduated from Kansas State with a B.S. in Biochemistry and I have dedicated my time since to learning
                C# utilizing various online resources like codecadamy, Udemy, YouTube, and many more.
                My primary goal is to get a job as a full-stack developer or back-end developer and to that end
                I have established a working knowledge of many aspects of the software development life cycle, 
                best software practices, front and back-end development (C#, HTML, and CSS), and relational databases (SQL).
                Ultimately, I want to work with embedded systems, but right now I am focusing on learning and growing as a developer.

            <h5>CRUD Console Application</h5>
            <p>
                In my family we do not bet money, we bet beverages;
                if you lose a bet you have to get the winner a beverage of their choice.
                This is a simple console app I made that can keep track of bets that stores them in a localized SQL database.
